# Preface

This is a compilation of machine learning examples that I found. They are easy to understand, they address a fundamental principle, they explain why they chose a particular algorithm.

Some of them you will find very detailed; others are short and straight to the point.

## Prerequisites {.unnumbered}

I used R-3.6.3 and RStudio Preview 1.4. I also plan to use Anaconda, Miniconda and GNU Python for the parts where I make use of Python code.

All the code is reproducible.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bookdown")
# or the development version
# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```
